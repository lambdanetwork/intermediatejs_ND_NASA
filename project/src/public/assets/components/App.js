                    One of the most popular websites at NASA is the Astronomy Picture of the Day. In fact, this website is one of

                    This endpoint structures the APOD imagery and associated metadata so that it can be repurposed for other
                    applications. In addition, if the concept_tags parameter is set to True, then keywords derived from the image
                    explanation are returned. These keywords could be used as auto-generated hashtags for twitter or instagram feeds;
                    but generally help with discoverability of relevant imagery.
